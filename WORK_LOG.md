| February 7 | 8:45pm-9:45pm | I did a bunch of practice problems trying to identify the optimal substructure for this problem using Mr. Blick's hint that you should consider starting from the middle somehow and using dynamic programming + a 2D array. I didn't see anything immediately but given that we were using a 2D array for the recursion, I knew i and j had to work together in some way like they did in Making Change. So, I decided to make my 2D array of row size doc1 and col size doc2 because that seemed most reasonable. I first considered a boolean array that checked if 2 substrings are the same but figured integers would be better for dynamic programming. I considered how "i" and "j" could be used and decide that i could represent the current index in the first doc and same for j. Then, I think I can do something where I check the "longest run" up to a current index for i and j somehow and store that in the array. But, I'm not sure if that index would have to be the same as I move through the 2D array. I declared and initialized the array and made a recursive function that has base cases where i or j equals 0 since going up to the 0th letter in either the first or second doc should yield a string of length 0 that can't be the same as the other doc. |
