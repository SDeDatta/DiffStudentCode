| February 7  | 8:45pm-9:45pm  | I did a bunch of practice problems trying to identify the optimal substructure for this problem using Mr. Blick's hint that you should consider starting from the middle somehow and using dynamic programming + a 2D array. I didn't see anything immediately but given that we were using a 2D array for the recursion, I knew i and j had to work together in some way like they did in Making Change. So, I decided to make my 2D array of row size doc1 and col size doc2 because that seemed most reasonable. I first considered a boolean array that checked if 2 substrings are the same but figured integers would be better for dynamic programming. I considered how "i" and "j" could be used and decide that i could represent the current index in the first doc and same for j. Then, I think I can do something where I check the "longest run" up to a current index for i and j somehow and store that in the array. But, I'm not sure if that index would have to be the same as I move through the 2D array. I declared and initialized the array and made a recursive function that has base cases where i or j equals 0 since going up to the 0th letter in either the first or second doc should yield a string of length 0 that can't be the same as the other doc. |

I coded the base cases and memoization steps pretty smoothly but was unsure how to move from there for a while. I then realized if two letters where matching ata given index, it would be 1 + the previous spot in the arrays so I inputted that. Then, I figured if two letters weren't the same, the number of similarities is the same as the previous row or column spot. It took me some time to realize that the result would actually be the max between those which is when I decided to use math.max. Along the way, I realized it would be easy to look back in the array so starting my indices at the length of the doc was helpful rather than the middle. My code now passes all the tests except for one in which it is off by 1. I've looked through all my code and haven't found any errors in it, using the help of the debugger as well. |

I coded it very similarly to how I did making change, by inputting 0s at any spot in the array with an index at 0. I originally tried ot do that for both rows and columns in the same for loop before realizing that wouldn't work because doc1 and doc2 have different lengths. I completed my code following the structure I used in Making Change and fixed an off by one error to complete my code. |
